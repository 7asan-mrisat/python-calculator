# Python Command-Line Calculator ‚ûï‚ûñ‚úñÔ∏è‚ûó

### *My First Steps into Interactive Math with Python!*

## üöÄ Project Overview

Welcome to my Python Command-Line Calculator! This project is a foundational piece in my coding journey, representing one of my earliest attempts to build a functional, interactive tool using Python. It's a simple, text-based calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations directly in your terminal.

While it might seem small, creating this calculator was a crucial learning experience. It helped me understand how to take user input, process numerical data, and apply conditional logic to execute different operations. It's a testament to the power of breaking down complex problems (like performing calculations) into manageable, code-driven steps!

## ‚ú® Features

This calculator currently supports the four fundamental arithmetic operations:

* **Addition (`+`)**
* **Subtraction (`-`)**
* **Multiplication (`*`)**
* **Division (`/`)**
* **Simple User Interface:** Guides the user through entering numbers and selecting an operation.
* **Clear Results:** Displays the outcome of the calculation directly in the console.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run

Ready to do some quick math? Here's how you can run this calculator on your local machine:

1.  **Clone the repository** (or copy the code into a `.py` file):
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/7asan-mrisat/python-calculator]
    cd python-calculator
    ```
    
2.  **Execute the Python script:**
    ```bash
    python calc.py
    ```
    (Assuming you save the code as `calc.py`)

3.  **Follow the prompts** in your terminal to input your numbers and choose an operation.

## üß† What I Learned

Building this calculator, even in its basic form, provided invaluable insights into core programming concepts:

* **Input and Output (`input()`, `print()`):** Effectively taking data from the user and displaying results back to them.
* **Data Types and Type Conversion:** Understanding how to convert string input into numerical types (`int()` or `float()`) to perform calculations.
* **Conditional Logic (`if`, `elif`, `else`):** Directing the program's flow based on the user's chosen operation.
* **Basic Arithmetic Operators:** Putting the fundamental mathematical operators into practice within code.
* **Problem Decomposition:** Breaking down a larger task (a calculator) into smaller, manageable coding challenges.

## üîÆ Future Enhancements (My Next Steps)

I'm always looking to expand my projects! Here are some ideas for how this calculator could evolve:

* **Error Handling:** Implement robust checks for invalid input (e.g., non-numeric input, division by zero).
* **More Operations:** Add support for exponents, modulo, square roots, etc.
* **Looping for Continuous Calculations:** Allow users to perform multiple calculations without restarting the script.
* **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** Transition from a command-line interface to a visual application using libraries like Tkinter or Pygame.
* **Operator Precedence:** Handle complex expressions (e.g., `2 + 3 * 4`).
